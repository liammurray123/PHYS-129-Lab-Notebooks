Important note: Most questions in this worksheet ask you to explain why you can perform a certain step. The explanations do not need to be mathematically rigorous. What we want is a level of detail in your explanation that would allow a confused peer in the course to read it and understand the “why” part. For example, you might explain a step in an algebraic manipulation of a function as “the function looks like y=mx+b and we know how to fit a graph to this function.”"

In this part of the experiment your independent variable is mass (M) and your dependent variable is the period (T). When performing the oscillation experiment we want you to vary the masses used so that you can create a graph where the slope can be used to find the spring constant k.
